# Image Compression

This data set includes the following variables:
\ 

## Objective

This was a task issued by Sunayu as an evaluation of approach, style, ability, and performance. The R script will compress an image successfully by removing some information without losing the overall detail. Thus, the image will require less memory for storage, interpretation, and it still remains meaningful and informative.

## Dataset ##

This algorithm too an image "Satellite.png" and compressed the image from 6.5MB at full color to several levels of clusters ranging from 2 to 128 - each level increased by a multiplication of 2. 
\

``` {r split cores}

split <- detectCores(TRUE)
cl <- makePSOCKcluster(split)
registerDoParallel(cl)

```

\

``` {r load the dataset, echo = TRUE}

image <- readPNG("C:/My Desktop/k means/Images/Satellite.png") # Read image into R

class(image) # Ensure data was read in
original_dim <- dim(image) # Keep original dimensions
dim(image) <- c(dim(image)[1]*dim(image)[2],3) # Reshape dimensions
dim(image) # Verify it worked

```

## Compression Algorithm

Here we will compress the image into compressed images with clusters of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128. 

This compression algorithm caused the original image to go from 6.5MB to:

- 2 clusters: 262KB
- 4 clusters: 459KB
- 8 clusters: 647KB
- 16 clusters: 1.05MB
- 32 clusters: 1.54MB
- 64 clusters: 1.94MB
- 128 clusters: 2.57MB

Here is the original photo for comparison:

``` {r original, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}

include_graphics("C:/My Desktop/k means/Images/Satellite.png") # Output original image

```

Now here are the compressed images:

Compressed image with 2 clusters
\

``` {r compression2, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}

# Compress with 2 centers

n <- 2
kmeans_image <- kmeans(image, centers = n, iter.max = 100) # Run kmeans clustering algorithm
img <- kmeans_image$centers[kmeans_image$cluster,] # Retrieve colors
dim(img) <- original_dim # Reshape back to original dimensions
include_graphics("C:/My Desktop/k means/Images/Satellite-compressed-2.png") # Output compressed image

```

Compressed image with 4 clusters
\

``` {r compression4, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}

# Compress with 4 centers

n <- 4
kmeans_image <- kmeans(image, centers = n, iter.max = 100) # Run kmeans clustering algorithm
img <- kmeans_image$centers[kmeans_image$cluster,] # Retrieve colors
dim(img) <- original_dim # Reshape back to original dimensions
include_graphics("C:/My Desktop/k means/Images/Satellite-compressed-4.png") # Output compressed image

```

Compressed image with 8 clusters
\

``` {r compression8, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}

# Compress with 8 centers

n <- 8
kmeans_image <- kmeans(image, centers = n, iter.max = 100) # Run kmeans clustering algorithm
img <- kmeans_image$centers[kmeans_image$cluster,] # Retrieve colors
dim(img) <- original_dim # Reshape back to original dimensions
include_graphics("C:/My Desktop/k means/Images/Satellite-compressed-8.png") # Output compressed image

```

Compressed image with 16 clusters
\

``` {r compression16, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}

# Compress with 16 centers

n <- 16
kmeans_image <- kmeans(image, centers = n, iter.max = 100) # Run kmeans clustering algorithm
img <- kmeans_image$centers[kmeans_image$cluster,] # Retrieve colors
dim(img) <- original_dim # Reshape back to original dimensions
include_graphics("C:/My Desktop/k means/Images/Satellite-compressed-16.png") # Output compressed image

```

Compressed image with 32 clusters
\

``` {r compression32, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}

# Compress with 32 centers

n <- 32
kmeans_image <- kmeans(image, centers = n, iter.max = 100) # Run kmeans clustering algorithm
img <- kmeans_image$centers[kmeans_image$cluster,] # Retrieve colors
dim(img) <- original_dim # Reshape back to original dimensions
include_graphics("C:/My Desktop/k means/Images/Satellite-compressed-32.png") # Output compressed image

```

Compressed image with 64 clusters
\

``` {r compression64, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}

# Compress with 64 centers

n <- 64
kmeans_image <- kmeans(image, centers = n, iter.max = 100) # Run kmeans clustering algorithm
img <- kmeans_image$centers[kmeans_image$cluster,] # Retrieve colors
dim(img) <- original_dim # Reshape back to original dimensions
include_graphics("C:/My Desktop/k means/Images/Satellite-compressed-64.png") # Output compressed image

```

Compressd image with 128 clusters
\

``` {r compression128, out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}

# Compress with 128 centers

n <- 128
kmeans_image <- kmeans(image, centers = n, iter.max = 100) # Run kmeans clustering algorithm
img <- kmeans_image$centers[kmeans_image$cluster,] # Retrieve colors
dim(img) <- original_dim # Reshape back to original dimensions
include_graphics("C:/My Desktop/k means/Images/Satellite-compressed-128.png") # Output compressed image
